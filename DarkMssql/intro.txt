Hi guys

before I post my tool.
Each one of us knows that extracting data from a ms sql server DBMS is the most boring of all the other DBMS. 
Sometimes it takes more than 1 hour to retrieve the names of dbs only. 
Despite the fact that there is nothing complex but just for each data we must do a different queries .
and that's why there are an automatic scripts as Sqlmap, fast-track ... 
Then I got the idea to create a php automatic script! 
Why php? 
1 - It is a langage that I'm coding well than others (Perl or Python xD). 
2 - To benefit from the power and high speed of servers that exists on net. 
3 - For Safety reasens: because you know if the admin track an attack he will find that it was executed behind a server. 
And when I tested I was really impressed by the results because I could extract the name of 310 dbs in 3 minutes and 10 seconds. 
it's a huge because if it was done manually  it should take more than 10 hours.
And with darkmssql I never could get all the dbs and even to retrieve 90 dbs its takes more than 10 minutes.

Now i'll show you the major Features at this point v1.0

-- Capable of displaying all databases user has access too
-- Capable of displaying tables in a specific database
-- Capable of displaying columns in a specific database and table

And for all the options I made a copy from Darkmssql.py :)
